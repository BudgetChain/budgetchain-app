# BudgetChain App

A decentralized financial management system built on StarkNet using Cairo contracts.

## Overview

BudgetChain is a blockchain-based budgeting and financial management system that allows users to create, track, and manage budgets in a transparent and secure way. Built on StarkNet using Cairo, BudgetChain provides a gas-efficient and scalable solution for financial management.

## Features

- **Decentralized Budget Management**: Create and manage budgets on the blockchain
- **Transparent Financial Tracking**: All transactions are recorded on-chain
- **Gas-Efficient**: Built on StarkNet for low transaction costs
- **Scalable**: Leverages StarkNet's high throughput capabilities
- **Secure**: Smart contract-based security with role-based access control

## Prerequisites

- [Scarb](https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/) - Cairo package manager
- [SNFoundry](https://foundry-rs.github.io/starknet-foundry/) - Testing framework for StarkNet
- [StarkNet](https://starknet.io/) - Layer 2 scaling solution

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/budgetchain-app.git
cd budgetchain-app
```

2. Navigate to the contracts directory:
```bash
cd contracts
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
scarb build
```

### Building the Project

To build the smart contracts:

```bash
cd contracts
scarb build
```

### Testing

Run the test suite using SNFoundry:

```bash
cd contracts
snforge test
```

## Smart Contracts

The core functionality is implemented through individual Cairo smart contracts, each handling a specific aspect of financial management:

- **Budget Contract**: Create, manage, and track budgets
- **Milestones Contract**: Track project milestones and deadlines
- **Expenses Contract**: Record and categorize expenses
- **Goals Contract**: Set and monitor financial goals
- **Reports Contract**: Generate financial reports and analytics
- **Transaction Ledger Contract**: Record and track all financial transactions
- **Project Management Contract**: Manage projects, tasks, and team collaboration
- **Organization Management Contract**: Handle organizational structure and permissions

Each contract is independently deployable and can be used standalone or in combination with others. Notifications and alerts are handled off-chain through the application layer.

## Architecture

BudgetChain leverages StarkNet's capabilities to provide:

- **Low Gas Costs**: StarkNet's L2 scaling reduces transaction fees
- **High Throughput**: Process multiple budget operations efficiently
- **Security**: Cryptographic guarantees through smart contracts
- **Transparency**: All operations are publicly verifiable
