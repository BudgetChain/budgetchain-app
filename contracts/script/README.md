# BudgetChain Deployment Scripts

This directory contains deployment scripts for all BudgetChain smart contracts, following the pattern from the InheritX project.

## Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
cd script
npm install
```

### 2. Configure Environment

Copy the environment template and fill in your values:

```bash
cp env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your StarkNet account details and network configuration.

### 3. Build Contracts

Before deploying, ensure all contracts are built:

```bash
# Build individual contracts
cd ../Budget && scarb build && cd ..
cd ../Milestones && scarb build && cd ..
cd ../Expenses && scarb build && cd ..
cd ../Goals && scarb build && cd ..
cd ../Reports && scarb build && cd ..
cd ../TransactionLedger && scarb build && cd ..
cd ../ProjectManagement && scarb build && cd ..
cd ../OrganizationManagement && scarb build && cd ..

# Or build all contracts
for contract in Budget Milestones Expenses Goals Reports TransactionLedger ProjectManagement OrganizationManagement; do
    echo "Building $contract..."
    cd $contract && scarb build && cd ..
done
```

## Deployment

### Deploy Individual Contracts

```bash
# Deploy specific contracts
npm run deploy:budget
npm run deploy:milestones
npm run deploy:expenses
npm run deploy:goals
npm run deploy:reports
npm run deploy:transaction-ledger
npm run deploy:project-management
npm run deploy:organization-management
```

### Deploy All Contracts

```bash
npm run deploy:all
```

## Scripts Overview

### Individual Deployment Scripts

Each contract has its own deployment script:

- `deploy_budget.js` - Deploy Budget Management Contract
- `deploy_milestones.js` - Deploy Milestone Tracking Contract
- `deploy_expenses.js` - Deploy Expense Tracking Contract
- `deploy_goals.js` - Deploy Financial Goals Contract
- `deploy_reports.js` - Deploy Reports and Analytics Contract
- `deploy_transaction_ledger.js` - Deploy Transaction Ledger Contract
- `deploy_project_management.js` - Deploy Project Management Contract
- `deploy_organization_management.js` - Deploy Organization Management Contract

### Batch Deployment Script

- `deploy_all.js` - Deploy all contracts in sequence with progress tracking

## Deployment Output

Each deployment script generates:

1. **Console Output**: Real-time deployment progress and status
2. **Deployment JSON**: Individual contract deployment details
3. **Consolidated Report**: Summary of all deployments (when using `deploy_all.js`)

## Environment Variables

### Required Variables

- `STARKNET_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS` - Your StarkNet account address
- `STARKNET_PRIVATE_KEY` - Your account private key
- `STARKNET_NETWORK` - Network (testnet/mainnet)
- `ADMIN_ADDRESS` - Default admin address for contracts

### Optional Variables

- `BUDGET_ADMIN_ADDRESS` - Specific admin for Budget contract
- `MILESTONES_ADMIN_ADDRESS` - Specific admin for Milestones contract
- `EXPENSES_ADMIN_ADDRESS` - Specific admin for Expenses contract
- `GOALS_ADMIN_ADDRESS` - Specific admin for Goals contract
- `REPORTS_ADMIN_ADDRESS` - Specific admin for Reports contract
- `TRANSACTION_LEDGER_ADMIN_ADDRESS` - Specific admin for TransactionLedger contract
- `PROJECT_MANAGEMENT_ADMIN_ADDRESS` - Specific admin for ProjectManagement contract
- `ORGANIZATION_MANAGEMENT_ADMIN_ADDRESS` - Specific admin for OrganizationManagement contract

## Network Configuration

### Sepolia Testnet (Default)
- Node URL: `https://starknet-sepolia.public.blastapi.io/rpc/v0_8`
- Network: `testnet`

### Mainnet
- Node URL: `https://starknet-mainnet.public.blastapi.io/rpc/v0_8`
- Network: `mainnet`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Contract Not Built**: Ensure contracts are compiled before deployment
2. **Insufficient Funds**: Check account balance for deployment fees
3. **Network Issues**: Verify network connectivity and node URL
4. **Invalid Addresses**: Ensure all addresses are valid StarkNet addresses

### Error Messages

- `Deployment failed: Insufficient balance` - Add funds to your account
- `Contract not found` - Build the contract first
- `Invalid constructor arguments` - Check environment variables

## Security Notes

- Never commit `.env` files to version control
- Use testnet for development and testing
- Verify all addresses before mainnet deployment
- Keep private keys secure and never share them
